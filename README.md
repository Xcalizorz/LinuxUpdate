# ManjaroUpdate
This is a small bash script that can update Manjaro Linux, create a new mirrorlist and delete old stuff.
I didn't like typing all the code in everytime, so I created a small bash script - 
maybe you're like me and I can help you with this :)


The plan is to create an easy command-line tool for (almost) all Linux Distros.

# Install
You will first need Manjaro installed.
Since I just started looking at bash, it might take a little bit to upload scripts for different linux distributions.
